# Dashboard_GumovskiMira_SupplementaryMaterial
This repository contains the supplementary material for the paper **"Parameter Space for Gumovski-Mira Map"** authored by **Diego Fregolent Mendes de Oliveira** and **Daniel Borin**. The goal of this project is to provide an interactive platform to explore the parameter space of the **Gumovski-Mira Map** using a **Streamlit** dashboard.

## Live Demo
